## 1-1 Introduction to Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** is the branch of statistics that helps us  summarize, organize, and understand data.

**Descriptive statistics helps answer:**
* What is a typical value?
* How much do values vary?
* Are there extreme values (outliers)?

### In ML why it matters

* Models learn patterns from data
* Poor understanding of data = poor model performance

**Descriptive statistics helps you:**

* Detect bad data
* Choose correct preprocessing
* Decide which model assumptions are valid.
* Avoid misleading averages.

* **Rule :** Never build a model before describing your data.

**Two main parts of descriptive statistics**

1. Central tendency --> mean, median, mode
2. Spread(Dispersion) --> variance, standard deviation


## 1-2 Mean, median and Mode (When each is appropriate)

Mean(Arithmetic Average)

Formuala:

Interpretation: Mean tells us the balance point of the data

**When Mean is Appropriate:**

* Data is symmetric
* No extreme outliers
* Examples

    * Exam scores
    * Heights
    * Temperatures

### 1-3 Variance and Standard Deviation as Measures of Spread

**Why measure spread**

A: 10, 10, 10, 10

B: 1, 10, 19, 30

Both mean = 10,
But B is much more spread out.

**Variance**

Formula(Sample Variance)

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

- **s²** — Sample Variance  
- **xᵢ** — i-th Observation (individual data point)  
- **x̄** — Sample Mean (average of all observations)  
- **(xi​−xˉ)** Deviation from the mean (Shows how far each value is from average)
- (xi​−xˉ)^2 Squared deviation
- **n** — Number of Observations (sample size)


What variance measures

- Average squared distance from the mean
- Show how much values fluctuate

Why Squared?

- Removes negative values
- Penalizes large deviations
- Makes math easier for ML optimization

**Standard deviation**

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

- **s** — Sample Standard Deviation
